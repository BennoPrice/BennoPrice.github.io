                    <span class="highlight">Internship</span> at <span class="highlight">SoftwareAG</span>
                    where I gained insights into the creation of software developed for various international clients as well as learning the internal workings of the company.
                    Not only did I learn about the programming side of <span class="highlight">SoftwareAG</span> but also how business is conducted as well as the monitisation of software.
                    Throughout my time at the company I worked on multiple projects including a PHP script in collaboration with an experienced software engineer.
                    The program would automatically parse and fill in templated word documents with client as well as project information.

                    <span class="highlight">Internship</span> at <span class="highlight">Cosynus</span>
                    where I was tasked with the development of a PHP REST API which allowed for the upload of encoded user profile images through a POST request.
                    The PHP portion of the project would sanitise inputs and decode the encoded image before storing it locally and adding a corresponding entry into a MariaDB database using SQL.
                    This work experience was organised by myself independantly of school during my spare time.
                    I wanted to experience how a smaller company such as <span class="highlight">Cosynus</span> operated in comparison to a large international company such as <span class="highlight">SoftwareAG</span>.
