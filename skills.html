                    <span class="highlight">Bilingual</span><br>
                    I speak both English and German fluently having lived in both countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">Operating System and Processor Internals</span><br>
                    I have extensively studied Windows and Processor internals both theoretically and practically.
                    I have largely read the Intel Software Developer Manual as well as Windows Internals 7th Edition and applied this knowledge by writing device drivers and directly interacting with page tables.

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">Reverse Engineering</span><br>
                    Through curiosity I have become skilled at reverse engineering. Combining my knowledge of Windows and Processor Internals as well as my knowledge of x86 assembly I have conducted a lot of practical reverse engineering.
                    Notably I reverse engineered many video games with commercial kernel anti-cheats as well as device drivers which I later exploited in order to gain ring0 arbitrary code execution.
                    I am very familiar with many of the industry leading tools such as IDA Pro, x86dbg, ReClass, Cheat Engine, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">Web and Web3</span><br>
                    I am very experienced in web development on both the frontend and backend. My current frontend stack consists of React.js with Node.js on the backend.
                    In addition I use GraphQL, Prisma, and Apollo for advanced and dynamic database management to reduce the overhead of a REST API.
                    Recently I have gotten heavily involved in Web3 development and have written many applications using Node.js and the Web3 library.
                    My area of interest in this space is decentralised finance (DeFi) which has additionally taught me many financial and economic concepts.
                    Notably I have developed a bot with Discord integration through the discord.js library.
                    I discovered a very powerful trading signal by analysing the blockchain and it's transactions.
                    The bot would then notify me and a couple friends of these events in realtime and we would trade based on them.
                    Using these signals we turned a $300 investment into $30,000 in a little less than a month which is a very impressive return by any metric.
                    In addition I have written and deployed my own EVM-compatible Solidity smart contracts on various networks such as Avalanche, Fantom, and Moonriver.

                    <span class="highlight">C++</span><br>
                    When working on lower level applications my language of choice is modern C++20 which I have been learning and using
                    for many years. I have a solid understanding of the language and try to make use of all it's features.
                    I regularly read the latest docs and tune into conferences in order to stay up to date with the latest additions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">Other</span><br>
                    I am also familiar with other programming languages such as Java, C#, Haskell, Python, PHP, and so on.
                    If need be I can easily learn a new language and it's syntax whilst carrying over conceptual knowledge from other languages.
